## Demo

You can view a fully working demo at [demo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app](https://demo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app/).

## Deploy to Vercel

Vercel deployment will guide you through creating a Supabase account and project.

After installation of the Supabase integration, all relevant environment variables will be assigned to the project so the deployment is fully functioning.

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fnext.js%2Ftree%2Fcanary%2Fexamples%2Fwith-supabase&project-name=nextjs-with-supabase&repository-name=nextjs-with-supabase&demo-title=nextjs-with-supabase&demo-description=This+starter+configures+Supabase+Auth+to+use+cookies%2C+making+the+user%27s+session+available+throughout+the+entire+Next.js+app+-+Client+Components%2C+Server+Components%2C+Route+Handlers%2C+Server+Actions+and+Middleware.&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fdemo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app%2F&external-id=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fnext.js%2Ftree%2Fcanary%2Fexamples%2Fwith-supabase&demo-image=https%3A%2F%2Fdemo-nextjs-with-supabase.vercel.app%2Fopengraph-image.png)

The above will also clone the Starter kit to your GitHub, you can clone that locally and develop locally.

If you wish to just develop locally and not deploy to Vercel, [follow the steps below](#clone-and-run-locally).

## Clone and run locally

1. You'll first need a Supabase project which can be made [via the Supabase dashboard](https://database.new)

2. Create a Next.js app using the Supabase Starter template npx command

   ```bash
   npx create-next-app --example with-supabase with-supabase-app
   ```

   ```bash
   yarn create next-app --example with-supabase with-supabase-app
   ```

   ```bash
   pnpm create next-app --example with-supabase with-supabase-app
   ```

3. Use `cd` to change into the app's directory

   ```bash
   cd with-supabase-app
   ```

4. Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local` and update the following:

   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=[INSERT SUPABASE PROJECT URL]
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[INSERT SUPABASE PROJECT API ANON KEY]
   ```

   Both `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` can be found in [your Supabase project's API settings](https://app.supabase.com/project/_/settings/api)

5. You can now run the Next.js local development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The starter kit should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

6. This template comes with the default shadcn/ui style initialized. If you instead want other ui.shadcn styles, delete `components.json` and [re-install shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/next)

> Check out [the docs for Local Development](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/getting-started/local-development) to also run Supabase locally.

## Feedback and issues

## Local Development

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env.local` file with the following environment variables:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-project-url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-supabase-service-role-key
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your-stripe-publishable-key
   STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your-stripe-secret-key
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-stripe-webhook-secret
   NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PREMIUM_PRICE_ID=your-stripe-premium-price-id
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
   ```
4. Create the Supabase tables and functions using the SQL files:
   - `supabase-schema.sql` - Creates the database tables and RLS policies
   - `supabase-functions.sql` - Creates the database functions

5. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application

## Project Structure

- `app/` - Next.js application code
  - `(auth-pages)/` - Authentication pages (sign-in, sign-up, forgot-password)
  - `dashboard/` - User dashboard
  - `upload/` - Outfit upload page
  - `outfit/` - Outfit details page
  - `settings/` - User settings (profile, integrations, subscription)
  - `api/` - API routes
- `components/` - Reusable React components
- `utils/` - Utility functions
- `lib/` - Shared libraries and helpers

## Stripe Integration

This demo includes simulated Stripe integration for subscription management. In a production environment, you would need to:

1. Set up a Stripe account and create subscription products
2. Configure webhook endpoints for subscription events
3. Replace the simulated code with actual Stripe API calls

## Supabase Storage Setup

The application uses Supabase Storage for storing outfit images. Follow these steps to set up the required storage buckets:

1. Set the required environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` if not done already
   - Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` are set

2. Run the bucket creation script:
   ```bash
   npx tsx utils/supabase/create-buckets.ts
   ```

3. Set up storage policies in Supabase Dashboard:
   - Navigate to your Supabase project > Storage > Policies
   - Create policies for the "outfits" bucket:
     - Policy for users to access only their files: `storage.foldername(1)::uuid = auth.uid()`
     - Add separate read/write policies as needed

This sets up the required "outfits" bucket with appropriate file size limits (5MB) and allowed file types (JPEG, PNG, WEBP).
