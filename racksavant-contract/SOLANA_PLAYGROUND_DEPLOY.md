# ðŸš€ RackSavant Deployment via Solana Playground

## Quick Deployment (5 minutes)

Since the local BPF tools installation is taking time, here's how to deploy immediately using Solana Playground:

### Step 1: Open Solana Playground
1. Go to https://beta.solpg.io
2. Create a new Anchor project
3. Name it "RackSavant"

### Step 2: Copy Your Contract Code

**Main Contract (`lib.rs`)**:
```rust
// Copy the entire contents from: programs/racksavant/src/lib.rs
```

**Revenue Module (`revenue.rs`)**:
```rust  
// Copy the entire contents from: programs/racksavant/src/revenue.rs
```

### Step 3: Update Cargo.toml
```toml
[package]
name = "racksavant"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Created with Anchor"
edition = "2021"

[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib", "lib"]
name = "racksavant"

[features]
no-entrypoint = []
no-idl = []
no-log-ix-name = []
cpi = ["no-entrypoint"]
default = []

[dependencies]
anchor-lang = "0.30.1"
anchor-spl = "0.30.1"
```

### Step 4: Build and Deploy
1. Click "Build" in Solana Playground
2. Wait for build to complete
3. Click "Deploy" 
4. Select "Devnet"
5. Confirm deployment

### Step 5: Get Program ID
After deployment, you'll get a Program ID like:
`Fg6PaFpoGXkYsidMpWTK6W2BeZ7FEfcYkg476zPFsLnS`

### Step 6: Test Your Contract
Use the built-in testing environment in Solana Playground to:
1. Initialize platform
2. Register a designer
3. Upload a design
4. Test purchase flow

## Advantages of Solana Playground
- âœ… No local toolchain issues
- âœ… Instant deployment to devnet  
- âœ… Built-in testing environment
- âœ… Easy program ID management
- âœ… Works immediately without BPF tools

## Next Steps
Once deployed via Solana Playground:
1. Copy the Program ID
2. Update your local client files with the new Program ID
3. Test the contract functions
4. Continue with your local development using the deployed contract

This approach gets you a working deployed contract in 5 minutes while your local BPF tools finish installing in the background!
