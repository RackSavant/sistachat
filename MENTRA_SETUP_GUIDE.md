4. Make sure these settings are configured:

   - **Permissions**: Camera, Microphone
5. Save your app and copy the API key

### 2. Update Environment Variables

   ```

### 4. Expose Your Local Server with ngrok

   ```bash
   npm install -g ngrok
   ```

2. Start ngrok to expose your Mentra integration server:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 3001
   ```

3. Copy the HTTPS URL provided by ngrok (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok.io`)

### 5. Update Your Mentra OS App URL
